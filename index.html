      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>After being laid off from my editing job in June 2020, I started teaching myself coding (basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). I wound up enjoying it, and decided to see if I could expand my skillset and switch careers. I've always been interested in tech, but never thought I could learn to code, so I'm hoping I can prove myself wrong!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I spent my childhood years in Northern Ontario, and I'm currently calling Toronto home.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Playing video games, baking, and exploring with my dog. :)</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Something that uses my newfound coding skills and allows me to be creative!</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Downtown Toronto, but looking to relocate.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I'm looking for a new career and challenge after working in a different field which I really disliked.</p>
